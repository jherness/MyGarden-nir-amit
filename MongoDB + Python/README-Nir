Hello Tami, our final project in MongoDB is our final project
for the practical software engineer Database.

We are creating a smart irrigation system for home use,
so our Database is not the biggest.
That being said it was crucial that our database would be
well orginaized and properly conducted.

Beacuse the base of our final database is the "samples" collection,
where each document is a sample from our sensors, we needed to mimic
samples as close to "real life" as possible. 
So we decided to create a Python programme, which takes into account
all the diffrent variables of "true" sample (time of the day, 
peiod of the year, seasons, location and so on), and upload it
the database in the appropriate collection. 

We added the code for the programme just in case you wanted to examine it,
of course we also added the JSON code for addition of the "samples"
collesctions to this folder in case you dont mind the python programme.
Take into account the the programme randomly generates samples according
to our guidlines. 

**IF SAMPLES DOESN'T COPIED PROPRLY YOU WILL NEED TO ACTIVATE THE
**PYTHON PROGRAM FOR IT TO INSERT THE DATA! 

Please note that the data in activation_reason collection and handle_expection collection
Are in the same respective order.


We are also adding an introduction for each collection,
for your convenience.  


-----Example for sample document from samples collection:-----
{
        "_id" : ObjectId("62de7a89620fc6798b0f53c8"),
        "id" : int number,
        "datetime_of_sample" : ISODate object,
        "light_sensor_data" : float number,
        "first_moist_sensor" : float number,
        "second_moist_sensor" : float number,
        "third_moist_sensor" : float number,
        "first_atmosphere_sensor_data" : float number,
        "second_atmosphere_sensor_data" : float number,
        "is_raining" : boolean. data calculated by temperature sensor data & atmosphere sensors data
        "temperature_sensor_data" : float number
}


-----Example for activation_history document:-----
{
        "_id" : ObjectId("62de7a89620fc6798b0f7601"),
        "id" : int number,
        "datime_of_activation" : ISODate object,
        "activation_reason" : String,
        "handle_code" : array of booleans the size of 4. with data for each transmission whether to activate
}


-----Example for activation_reason document:-----
{ "_id" : "1", "msg" : "Everthing Is Under Control" }





-----Example for handle_excpection document:-----
*** code is the data that is being sent to the transmissions to start/stop
{ "_id" : "1", "code" : [ false, false, false, false ] }




-----Example for ex_counters document:-----
{ "_id" : "No Light", "value" : 2366 }




-----Example for ex_counters document:-----
{
        "_id" : ObjectId("62e78e0448f854a0562625c7"),
        "id" : 0,
        "datetime_of_sample" : ISODate("2021-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
        "temperature_sensor_data" : 7.2220540046691895,
        "light_sensor_data" : 303.3699951171875,
        "atmosphere_sensors_data" : 1011.9618530273438,
        "moist_sensors_data" : 59.15953572591146,
        "is_raining" : false
}
